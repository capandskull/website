            We're kicking off a year of celebrating one hundred and twenty years of the Banks of the Old Raritan! Join Cap & Skull on January 18th at the Rutgers Club from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. for camaraderie, cocktails, and celebration! It is not an anniversary party to be missed! Don't live locally? We still want to celebrate with you! Look out for details about Founder's Day events happening across the country in the Baltimore-DC area and the San Francisco Bay Area.
